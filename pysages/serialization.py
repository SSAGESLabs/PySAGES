"""
Utilities for saving and loading the results of `pysages` simulations.

This module provides two functions for managing the persistent storage of a `pysages`
simulation's state using pickle serialization (via the `dill` library).

* `load(filename)`: Attempts to load the simulation state from a file and return
  the corresponding `Result` object.
* `save(result, filename)`: Saves the given `Result` object to a file.

**Note:**

These functions assume pickle's `DEFAULT_PROTOCOL` and data format. Use them with caution
if modifications have been made to the saved data structures.
