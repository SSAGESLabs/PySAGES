Collective variable for orientations describe the orientation measures

RMSD describes distances between three-dimensional structures.

eRMSD describes distances between three-dimensional
RNA structures. The standard RMSD is not accurate enough for distinguish
RNA 3D structures. eRMSD provides a way to measuring the difference in
the base interacting network.
eRMSD also only requires the knowledge of C2, C4 and C6 for each base.

    coarse-grained version of eRMSD which pass in different base sites
    other than the default C2/4/6 used by eRMSD.
    Thus we first need to infer the positions of C2/4/6 using rigid
    ideal base references and then do standard eRMSD calculations.

    Parameters
    ------------
    rs: (n_nucleotides*3, 3) array
        current snapshots of selected sites
    reference: (n_nucleotides*3, 3) array
        reference of the selected sites
        The last dimension is the x,y,z of the
        cartesian coordinates of the reference position of the C2/C4/C6 atoms,
        with the same order as the indices.
    sequence: list[int]
        a list of int with length=n_nucleotides, each element is 0 (A) or 1 (U)
        or 2 (G) or 3 (C)
    local_coordinates: (4,3,2) array
        Must be a list of tuple of floats, with dimension (4, 3, 2)
        Local coordinates of [C2, C6, C4] (A/G) or [C2, C4, C6] (U/C).
    cutoff: float
        unitless cutoff. Default is 2.4
    a: float
        re-scaling scale in x and y direction. Default is 0.5 (nm).
    b: float
        re-scaling scale in z direction. Default is 0.3 (nm).
