"""
Adaptive Biasing Force (ABF) sampling method.

ABF partitions the collective variable space into bins determined by a user
provided grid, and keeps a tabulation of the number of visits to each bin
as well as the sum of generalized forces experienced by the system at each
configuration bin. These provide an estimate for the mean generalized force,
which can be integrated to yield the free energy.

The implementation of the adaptive biasing force method here closely follows
https://doi.org/10.1063/1.2829861. One important difference is that the time
derivative of the product :math:`W\\cdot p` (equation 9 of reference) is
approximated by a second order backward finite difference in the simulation
time step.
